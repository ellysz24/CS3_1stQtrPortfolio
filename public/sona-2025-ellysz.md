## by Kathrin Ellysz Dalimot - Potassium - K09
1.  Give 2-4 key points from the SONA 2025 that you found interesting
* Lowering the obesity rate of the Filipinos
* The government managed to confiscate 83 billion worth of illegal substances as well as arresting 153,000 drug dealers.

Explanation: This reminds me of the previous president Duterte’s “War on Drugs” that involved extra-judicial killings.  
* The Love Bus being brought back to become a way of free public transport

Explanation: Considering the Philippines doesn’t have free public transport, I was surprised to find out they were planning to make the bus free.
2.  Give 1-3 key points from SONA 2025 that you found weird for any reason (explaining is optional)
* Marcos used the saying “A friend to all, an enemy to none” to describe how the country would treat other countries.

Explanation: This makes the Philippines prone to being taken advantage of by other countries as shown in our history.
* He mentioned many goals throughout his speech but never brought up how he would achieve them.
 
3.  Write 2 paragraphs of reflection (each paragraph is ideally around 4 sentences)
          
The SONA 2025 shed light on many issues of the Philippines as well as the progress the president is making to address them.  These issues included agriculture, education, healthcare, infrastructure and public transportation and other national concerns.  He then discussed his future goals for the next half of his presidency.  He ended his speech by encouraging the Filipinos to stay strong and stick to their values.

     
While the SONA covered many of the president’s achievements and goals, he never explained how he would achieve these goals. With all these goals and an unclear process, it seems unlikely that he will perform everything he mentioned, nonetheless achieve it.  Despite this, we should still hang on to every bit of hope by continuously working towards an improved country and better future.

4.  What 1 word/ phrase/ or sentence do you have for the Philippines after hearing SONA 2025?

Never-ending hope
